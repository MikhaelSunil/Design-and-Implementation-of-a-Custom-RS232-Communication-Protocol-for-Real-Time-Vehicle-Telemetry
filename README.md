# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Custom-RS232-Communication-Protocol-for-Real-Time-Vehicle-Telemetry

 üìå Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a distributed embedded system for automotive monitoring. The system comprises three microcontroller-based units:&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Distance Sensor Unit:** : Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and measure distances.
- **Fuel and Speed Sensor Unit:** :Monitors fuel consumption and vehicle speed using digital input signals.
- **Display Unit:** :Receives data from sensor units and provides real-time feedback to the driver through an LCD display and auditory alerts.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Custom Serial Communication Protocol:** :Ensures reliable data exchange between units with error detection capabilities.
- **Modular Codebase:** :Structured for scalability and ease of maintenance, with separate modules for each unit.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** :Provides immediate feedback to the driver based on sensor data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** :Displays critical information and alerts through an LCD and auditory signals.
